# Build Suricata IPS mode (WinDivert) from source - fully automated
# ============================================================================
# Reproduces, end-to-end, the from-source build validated 2026-07-04/05.
# The official Suricata Windows MSI (used by agb-full-setup.ps1) is IDS-only
# - it can only alert, never block, because Npcap is a PASSIVE capture
# driver. Real inline blocking (WinDivert) does not exist in the prebuilt
# MSI and requires compiling Suricata from source with WinDivert support
# explicitly enabled. This script does that whole build.
#
#   iwr https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yekyawhan/wazuh/git-home/suricata-win/build-suricata-ips.ps1 -UseBasicParsing | iex
#
# This is a SEPARATE, EXPERIMENTAL build - it does not touch or replace the
# existing IDS-mode Suricata install. Output lands in a standalone deploy
# folder for manual testing. See Suricata-IPS-Mode-Build-Guide.docx for the
# full narrative writeup (every error hit and why), or the "GOTCHA FIXED"
# comment blocks below for the condensed version.
#
# CHANGELOG 2026-07-07 (hardening review):
#   - NEW -RepoRef param: pin ALL repo downloads (rules + AR scripts) to a
#     commit SHA instead of the git-home branch (supply-chain protection)
#   - the two daily refresh tasks merged into ONE validated task: staged
#     download, per-file syntax whitelist, suricata -T check, auto-rollback,
#     single service restart (was: blind overwrite + 2 restarts/day)
#   - suricata -T config gate before the always-on service is installed
#   - WinSW wrapper fallback if the sc.exe-registered service hits the
#     classic console-app 1053 startup failure
#   - ET TOR direction-reversal regex now reports lines it could NOT
#     convert (ET format drift detection)
#   - SHA256 of deployed Active Response scripts logged for audit
#
# Requirements: Administrator PowerShell, ~5 GB free disk, internet access.
# Takes 20-60+ minutes depending on connection/CPU (largest cost: compiling
# ~250 Rust crates for Suricata's rust/ subsystem, plus the C source tree).
#
# INTERACTIVE by default - prompts for capture interface and HOME_NET (press
# Enter on either to auto-pick/keep the stock default), matching
# agb-full-setup.ps1's UX. Pass -NoPrompt to skip both and auto-pick
# everything, or -CaptureInterfaceName/-HomeNet to pre-supply either value
# non-interactively (piping via | iex can't pass parameters - download the
# script first if you need this).

The old "outbound"-only default silently broke ALL HTTP-content signatures (confirmed live 2026-07-07: zero event_type:http for external sites, so User-Agent/URL/etc. rules never fired) while leaving IP/DNS/ICMP rules working (those match single packets, no reassembly).

#   1. The old refresh tasks downloaded rules and IMMEDIATELY restarted the
#      service - a truncated download or an ET rule this build rejects would
#      restart the service into a failed state at 13:00 with nobody watching.
#      Now: everything downloads into a STAGING dir, every file is
#      syntax-checked (only comments/blank/pass/alert/drop/reject lines
#      allowed - kills truncated files, HTML error pages, and injected
#      content), the swap happens atomically with a backup, the FULL config
#      is validated with `suricata.exe -T`, and on failure the old rules are
#      rolled back and the service is left alone.
#   2. Two separate tasks (13:00 + 1:30 PM) each restarted the service -
#      every restart is a brief fail-open blocking gap. Merged into ONE task
#      with ONE restart.
#   3. The agb-* downloads pulled from a branch ref as SYSTEM daily - a
#      repo compromise = arbitrary rule injection on every deployed machine.
#      The syntax whitelist limits blast radius to rule content only (no
#      code execution), and -RepoRef lets you pin a commit SHA to freeze it
#      completely.
