# Uninstall EVERYTHING Suricata-related - both the IDS deployment and the
# experimental IPS (WinDivert) build
# ============================================================================
# Removes:
#   1. The regular IDS-mode Suricata install (agb-full-setup.ps1's work) -
#      by downloading and running agb-full-uninstall.ps1, so there is one
#      single source of truth for that logic rather than a duplicate copy.
#   2. The experimental IPS build (build-suricata-ips.ps1's work) - the
#      deploy folder, the MSYS2 build workspace, the Defender exclusion,
#      and the WinDivert kernel driver if it was ever registered (it only
#      registers the first time --windivert actually runs).

#
# KEEPS by default: Npcap, MSYS2 itself (a general dev toolchain, not
# Suricata-specific), and the Wazuh agent.
#   -AlsoRemoveNpcap    also uninstall Npcap (interactive)
#   -AlsoRemoveMsys2    also delete C:\msys64 entirely (the WHOLE toolchain,
#                       not just the Suricata build workspace inside it -
#                       only pass this if you installed MSYS2 solely for
#                       this build and don't want it for anything else)
#   -RemoveWazuhAgent   also uninstall the Wazuh agent (rare)
#   -WhatIfOnly         list what WOULD be removed, change nothing
