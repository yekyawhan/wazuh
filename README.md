# What This Repository Is For

This repository is intended to help build a practical **Wazuh monitoring lab** that covers both **host-based** and **network-based** visibility.

Typical use cases include:

* Deploying **Wazuh agents** to Windows and Linux endpoints
* Installing **Sysmon** to collect rich Windows telemetry
* Integrating **Suricata** alerts into Wazuh
* Building **custom active response** workflows
* Testing **detection engineering** and SOC automation use cases
* Creating a repeatable **Wazuh lab environment** for research or training

---

# Modules

## `active-response/pstools`

Custom scripts and supporting tools for **Wazuh Active Response** workflows.

This area is useful when you want Wazuh to take action automatically after an alert is triggered, for example:

* suspend or terminate suspicious processes
* launch PowerShell-based remediation
* trigger popup warnings to the endpoint user
* log automated response actions
* experiment with containment workflows in a lab

This folder is especially useful for **Windows endpoint response automation**.

---

## `docker`

Contains resources for building a **containerized Wazuh lab**.

This module is useful for:

* quickly deploying a Wazuh test environment
* standing up a temporary SIEM lab
* testing Wazuh rules, agent connectivity, and integrations
* creating a repeatable local lab for experiments

Typical content may include:

* Docker Compose files
* Wazuh stack deployment examples
* containerized lab helpers
* test environment setup notes

---

## `suricata-linux`

Linux-side **Suricata deployment and integration** for Wazuh.

This module is intended for environments where you want to collect **network intrusion detection** telemetry from Linux systems and centralize it in Wazuh.

Typical use cases:

* install Suricata on Linux hosts
* configure Eve JSON / alert output
* forward Suricata logs to Wazuh
* build network detection use cases
* test Linux-based IDS scenarios in a Wazuh lab

---

## `suricata-win`

Windows-focused Suricata integration resources.

This folder is useful for:

* experimenting with Suricata on Windows hosts
* forwarding Suricata alerts into Wazuh
* testing hybrid **host + network monitoring** on Windows
* evaluating Suricata behavior in Windows lab environments

---

## `sysmon`

Automation and deployment resources for **Microsoft Sysmon**.

Sysmon extends Windows logging and is commonly used with Wazuh to improve endpoint visibility. This module is intended for installing, configuring, and validating Sysmon on Windows endpoints.

Typical telemetry collected with Sysmon includes:

* process creation
* network connections
* image loads
* registry modifications
* file creation events
* persistence-related activity

This module is useful for **Windows detection engineering**, **threat hunting**, and **Wazuh endpoint telemetry enrichment**.

---

## `wz-agent-linux`

Linux Wazuh agent deployment resources.

This module is intended to simplify:

* Wazuh agent installation on Linux hosts
* agent registration / manager connectivity
* Linux endpoint onboarding into a Wazuh lab
* log collection and monitoring validation

---

## `wz-agent-windows`

Windows Wazuh agent deployment resources.

This module helps standardize:

* Wazuh agent installation on Windows hosts
* endpoint registration to the Wazuh manager
* Windows event collection preparation
* onboarding endpoints before adding Sysmon or active response workflows

---

# Example Monitoring Workflows

## Windows Endpoint Workflow

A typical Windows deployment with this repository might look like:

1. Install the **Wazuh Windows agent** from `wz-agent-windows`
2. Install **Sysmon** from `sysmon`
3. Configure Windows event collection for Sysmon logs
4. Add **Active Response** scripts from `active-response/pstools`
5. Tune Wazuh rules and alerts for Windows telemetry

This gives you:

* Windows endpoint visibility
* Sysmon process and network telemetry
* centralized alerting in Wazuh
* automated response actions for suspicious activity

---

## Linux Endpoint Workflow

A typical Linux deployment might look like:

1. Install the **Wazuh Linux agent** from `wz-agent-linux`
2. Deploy **Suricata** from `suricata-linux`
3. Forward Suricata alerts into Wazuh
4. Tune rules for host and network detections

This gives you:

* Linux host monitoring
* network IDS visibility
* centralized event correlation in Wazuh

---

## Full Lab Workflow

If you want to build a complete Wazuh lab:

1. Deploy the Wazuh stack using `docker`
2. Add Linux endpoints with `wz-agent-linux`
3. Add Windows endpoints with `wz-agent-windows`
4. Enable Sysmon with `sysmon`
5. Add Suricata from `suricata-linux` or `suricata-win`
6. Configure automated response scripts from `active-response/pstools`

This creates a practical environment for:

* SOC testing
* detection engineering
* incident response automation
* alert tuning
* endpoint + network monitoring experiments

# Notes

This project is structured as a **modular Wazuh lab toolkit** rather than a single-purpose script repository. Each folder focuses on one area of the monitoring stack, and together they support a practical workflow for:

* Windows endpoint monitoring
* Linux endpoint monitoring
* Sysmon telemetry collection
* Suricata network visibility
* Wazuh Active Response automation
