# Register the Suricata IPS (WinDivert) build as a persistent Windows
# service - auto-starts on boot, runs continuously in the background
# ============================================================================
# build-suricata-ips.ps1 deliberately stops short of this - everything up
# to now has been a manual, supervised foreground test you can Ctrl+C
# instantly. THIS script is the deliberate step up to unattended, always-on
# inline traffic blocking. Read the warning this script prints before
# confirming - this is a materially bigger commitment than anything the
# build script itself does automatically.

# Registered as its own distinct service name "SuricataIPS", NOT the
# generic "Suricata" name Suricata's own --service-install would use
# internally (PROG_NAME is a compile-time constant "Suricata", hardcoded,
# not configurable via CLI) - that name could collide with a regular
# IDS-mode Suricata service if one is ever installed on the same machine
# (agb-full-setup.ps1 doesn't currently register one as a service, but
# nothing stops a future setup from doing so). Using sc.exe directly with
# our own name avoids that collision entirely, at the cost of not using
# Suricata's built-in service control code path (its stop/shutdown signal
# handling in win32-service.c is generic Windows SCM API usage that works
# identically regardless of how the service was registered, so nothing is
# lost by doing it this way).
